In the digital age, email has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. However, with the increase in cyber threats, protecting email privacy and security has become particularly important.

## Why is Email Privacy Important?

Email is not just a communication tool; it is also:

- **Core of Identity Authentication**: Most online services use email for identity verification
- **Hub of Personal Information**: Emails store vast amounts of sensitive information
- **Primary Target of Cyber Attacks**: Hackers often conduct phishing attacks through email

When you register on websites or shop online, your email address may be:

- Used to send massive amounts of spam
- Added to marketing email lists

### 2. Phishing Attacks

Attackers use fake emails to try to:
- Steal your login credentials
- Obtain banking or credit card information
- Install malicious software

### 3. Data Breaches

Many companies have suffered data breaches, resulting in user email addresses being exposed.
